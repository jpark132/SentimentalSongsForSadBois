twice as wide as ours yeah you look happier you do    ain't nobody hurt you like i hurt you but ain't nobody love you like i do promise that i will not take it personal baby if you're moving on with someone new    'cause baby you look happier you do my friends told me one day i'll feel it too and until then i'll smile to hide the truth but i know i was happier with you    sat in the corner of the room everything's reminding me of you nursing an empty bottle and telling myself you're happier aren't you    oh ain't nobody hurt you like i hurt you but ain't nobody need you like i do i know that there's others that deserve you but my darling i am still in love with you    but i guess you look happier you do my friends told me one day i’ll feel it too i could try to smile to hide the truth but i know i was happier with you    ‘cause baby you look happier you do i knew one day you’d fall for someone new but if he breaks your heart like lovers do just know that i’ll be waiting here for you*  there was a time when i was alone no where to go and no place to call home my only friend was the man in the moon and even sometimes he would go away too then one night as i closed my eyes i saw a shadow flying high he came to me with the sweetest smile told me he wanted to talk for a while he said “peter pan that's what they call me i promise that you'll never be lonely” and ever since that day...    i am a lost boy from neverland usually hanging out with peter pan and when we're bored we play in the woods always on the run from captain hook "run run lost boy" they say to me away from all of reality neverland is home to lost boys like me and lost boys like me are free neverland is home to lost boys like me and lost boys like me are free    he sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe believe in him and believe in me together we will fly away in a cloud of green to your beautiful destiny as we soared above the town that never loved me i realized i finally had a family soon enough we reached neverland peacefully my feet hit the sand and ever since that day...    i am a lost boy from neverland usually hanging out with peter pan and when we're bored we play in the woods always on the run from captain hook "run run lost boy" they say to me away from all of reality neverland is home to lost boys like me and lost boys like me are free neverland is home to lost

runs away to you with a thought i hope you'll see can't see where it's wandered to but i know where it wants to be    i'm waiting patiently though time is moving slow i have one vacancy and i wanted you to know that    you're the one designed for me a distant stranger that i will complete i know you're out there we're meant to be so keep your head up and make it to me    so sick of this lonely air it seems such a waste of breath so much that i need to share so much to get off my chest    i'm waiting patiently though time is moving slow i have one vacancy and i wanted you to know that    you're the one designed for me a distant stranger that i will complete i know you're out there we're meant to be so keep your head up and make it to me    and make it to me and make it to me and make it to me and make it to me*  feeling used but i'm still missing you and i can't see the end of this just wanna feel your kiss against my lips and now all this time is passing by but i still can't seem

feelings are all fucking mixed always missing people that i shouldn't be missing sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance i know that i control my thoughts and i should stop reminiscing but i learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings when love and trust are gone i guess this is moving on everyone i do right does me wrong so every lonely night i sing this song    i hate you i love you i hate that i love you don't want to but i can't put nobody else above you i hate you i love you i hate that i want you you want her you need her and i'll never be her    all alone i watch you watch her like she's the only girl you've ever seen you don't care you never did you don't give a damn about me yeah all alone i watch you watch her she is the only thing you've ever seen how is it you never notice that you are slowly killing me    i hate you i love you i hate that i love you don't want to but i can't put nobody else above you i hate you i love you i hate that i want you you want her you need her and i'll never be her*  i took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill i threw the day old tea from the cup packed up the photo album matthew had made memories of a life that's been loved took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals poured the old ginger beer down the sink dad always told me "don't you cry when you're down" but mum there's a tear every time that i blink    oh i'm in pieces it's tearing me up but i know a heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved    so i'll sing hallelujah you were an angel in the shape of my mum when i fell down you'd be there holding me up spread your wings as you go when god takes you back he'll say "hallelujah you're home"    i fluffed the pillows made the beds stacked the chairs up folded your nightgowns neatly in a case john says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek and wiped a tear from the side of my face    i hope that i see the world as you did 'cause i know a life with love is a life that's been lived    so i'll sing hallelujah you were an angel in the shape of my mum when i fell down you'd be there holding me up spread your wings as you go when god takes you back he'll say "hallelujah you're home"    hallelujah you were an angel in the shape of my mum you got to see the person i have become spread your wings and i know that when god took you back he said "hallelujah you're home"*  she would not show that she was afraid but being and feeling alone was too much to face though everyone said that she was so strong what they didn't know is that she could barely carry on    but that she knew that she would be okay so she didn't let it get in her way    sometimes it all gets a little too much but you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up and you don't have to be afraid because we're all the same and we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much    she would always tell herself that she could do this she would use no help it would be just fine but when it got hard she would lose her focus so take my hand it will be alright    but that she knew that she would be okay so she didn't let it get in her way    sometimes it all gets a little too much but you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up and you don't have to be afraid because we're all the same and we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much    a little too much i said a little too much oh    sometimes it all gets a little too much but you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up and you don't have to be afraid because we're all the same and we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much sometimes it all gets a little too much but you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up and you don't have to be afraid because we're all the same and we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much it all gets a little too much*     feeling like i'm breathing my last breath feeling like i'm walking my last steps look at all of these tears i've

high heel lock up your doors with steel    they’re makin noise in my street my blinds are drawn i can’t see smashed in my car window didn’t touch the stereo    slow it down angie come back to bed rest your arms and rest your legs    act like you’ve been here before smile less and dress up some more tie up your scarf real tight these boys are out for blood tonight    slow it down angie come back to bed rest your arms and rest your legs    and when she stood she stood tall she’ll make a fool of you all don’t ask for cigarettes she ain’t got nothing left for you    i never she never we never looked back that wasn’t what we were good at and when it came to love we were not good enough on    slow it down angie come back to bed rest your arms and rest your legs don’t you frown when you’re

probably hanging out and making eyes while across the room he stares i'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor and ask my girl to dance and she'll say yes  because these words were never easier for me to say or her to second guess but i guess that i can live without you but without you i'll be miserable at best    you're all that i hoped i'd find in every single way and everything i would give is everything you couldn't take cause nothing feels like home you're a thousand miles away and the hardest part of living is just taking breaths to stay cause i know i'm good for something i just haven't found it yet but i need it so    let's not pretend like you're alone tonight i know he's there and you're probably hanging out and making eyes while across the room he stares i'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor and ask my girl to dance and she'll say yes because these words were never easier for me to say or her to second guess but i guess that i can live without you but without you i'll be miserable at best    and this will be the first time in a week that i'll talk to you and i can't speak it's been three whole days since i've had sleep cause i dream of his lips on your cheek and i got the point that i should leave you alone but we both know that i'm not that strong and i miss the lips that made me fly so    let's not pretend like you're alone tonight i know he's there and you're probably hanging out and making eyes while across the room he stares i'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor and ask my girl to dance and she'll say yes because these words were
